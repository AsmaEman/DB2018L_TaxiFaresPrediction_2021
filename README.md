# DB2018L_TaxiFaresPrediction_2021
The goal of this project is to explore features of a taxi trip that will be used to train a linear
regression model to predict the tips of a taxi trip. Given the total distance traveled, the trip duration and the trip fare, can we predict how much
tips a customer will spend in a trip. Since described in the original dataset, if the customer pays cash, the tips may not be recorded in the
dataset. Thus, we will predict the tips that were payed by cash and have left as zero in the dataset.
